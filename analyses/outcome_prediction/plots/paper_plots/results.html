<p><br><b>Epilepsy lateralization</b></br>We asked how well intra-hemispheric functional connectivity could lateralize epilepsy. We restricted analysis to patients with unilateral epilepsy and at least two symmetrically-implanted atlas regions in each hemisphere, which allowed us to calculate intra-hemispheric connectivity (47 patients). We constructed a logistic regression classifier to predict seizure onset lateralization. We used leave-one-out cross-validation, separately keeping each patient as testing data while training the model on the remaining patients. Predictors were average left intra-hemispheric connectivity and average right intra-hemispheric connectivity. The average accuracy of seizure onset zone laterality predictions was 80.9% (Fig. 4A). By comparison, a model including average left sided spike rates and average right sided spike rates as predictors had an accuracy of 66.7% (Fig. 4B), and a model incorporating both spike rates and connectivity had an accuracy of 80.0% (Fig. 4C). This suggests that comparing intra-hemispheric connectivity in a symmetric coverage atlas accurately identifies the side of the SOZ. Results were similar for a model based on the AAL atlas (Supplementary Figure 2).
